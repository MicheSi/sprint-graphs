* DFS will have less back tracking
* Will need to import a Stack class
* Will need to keep track of visited rooms in a set()
* Will need to keep track of the path taken so far with a path set()
* Assign starting room as 1st vertex in stack
* Keep track of available directions to move
* Account for having no neighboring rooms on a specific side
* As room is visited, add it to the path
* return path once all rooms have been visited
